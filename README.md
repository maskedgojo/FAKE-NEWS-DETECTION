# Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning
=============================================

## Introduction
------------

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a news article is fake or real. It utilizes Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to analyze news content and provide accurate classifications.

## Project Overview
-----------------

The goal of this project is to combat the spread of misinformation by automatically detecting fake news articles. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a carefully curated dataset, this project enables the classification of news articles as either fake or real.

## Key Features
--------------

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset containing news articles. Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization are used to transform text data into numerical features[1][2].
- **Model Development**: The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build predictive models[5][6].
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score[3][5].

## Technologies Used
--------------------

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **NLTK/Spacy**: For natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset
----------

The dataset used in this project typically includes labeled news articles, with each article marked as either fake or real. The dataset can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository[2][3].
